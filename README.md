# homework-calc

In this homework you will create a command line calculator.  It will take 2 integers on the command line and compute the sum, difference, product and the division of the 2 numbers.  Division will be integer division and display the fractional remainder.

## Requirements of the homework

* Program will be called calc
* Will include a Makefile that builds and cleans the code with correct dependencies
*  Each function will be a separate file and proper function prototypes in .h files will be included as well
*  Program should have built in help, i.e., it will display usage if command is typed and protect itself from human error.
*  All code should be properly commented as well.
*  Use branches and pull requests to change code.  You will just confirm and merge without review.
* This will be due at 11:59 PM on Monday before class.  Code must be in master to be considered for grade.

This program is pretty straight forward but there are some subtleties that you need to think about.  I would highly recommend not waiting till the last minute to start the work.
